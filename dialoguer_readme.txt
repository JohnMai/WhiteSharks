Until I finish something for everyone, you can just use the test
chat tree at ID 3

That's it so far.

The Global Variables with their IDs are at:
Booleans:
0 = guilty
1 = hasPObjectHallPass
2 = hasPObjectPicture
3 = hasPObjectBracelet

Floats:
1 = Liam_trustVal
2 = Nina_trustVal
3 = Josh_trustVal
4 = Noel_trustVal
5 = Peijun_trustVal
6 = Carlos_trustVal

Strings:
0 = archetype
1 = Josh_Witness_Category
2 = Josh_Alibi
3 = Liam_Witness_Category
4 = Liam_Alibi
5 = Nina_Witness_Category
6 = Nina_Alibi
7 = Carlos_Witness_Category
8 = Noel_Witness_Category
9 = Peijun_Witness_Category

the Alibi strings need to be input as
"Gym"
"Cafe"
else is the office

the Witness_category strings need to be input as
"smallProjectiles"
"bluntWeapons"
"sharpWeapons"
