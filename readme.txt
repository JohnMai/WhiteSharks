dialoguer_data.xml is what you'll need to put into the main game
at Assets->DialougerOutput->Resources->dialoguer_data.xml

There are no current global variables due to the lack of 
knowing how much character art weâ€™ll even have. We should list these
soon and figure out how to sort them, but when global variables are made
they will be 2 floats, each one telling dialoguer what sprite to draw
for either the left or right side. Then one boolean to tell which side is talking.

The dialogues are:
0 - intro
1 - Shammy intro
2 - Alexia intro
3 - Noel Case 1
4 - Carlos Case 1
5 - Alexia end Case 1
