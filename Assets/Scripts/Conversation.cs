	 * Since the main premise of what makes a NPC guilty, suspect or witness is the number of arguments his alibi has,
	 * it sets up a three way switch/case so that when it's guilty (it contains one element) it only uses that element and
	 * gets a random room from the game manager (so it could be a lie or not).
	 * If it's suspect or witness, it uses all the elements in his/her alibi (and returns them as string).
